    "# Python Capstone Project Idea Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Title  \n",
    "_What do you want to name your project?_  \n",
    "> Example: Snake Byte, BudgetBuddy, MyWeather, QuizCracker, TaskTamer\n",
    "\n",
    "--- GMS Pro - The Ultimate Gym Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description  \n",
    "_Describe what your project will do._  \n",
    "- What does it help the user do?\n",
    "- Is it a game, tool, or data-based app?\n",
    "- Is it terminal-based or does it have a GUI?\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Example: This project is a weather checker that allows users to enter a city name and receive current weather data. It uses the OpenWeather API and is displayed in the terminal._\n",
    "\n",
    "--- 1. GMS will help gym owners to track and manage the operations of their gym. It will register new members, update their personal workout plans, check payment schedules and provide data on the status on late payments, attendance etc\n",
    "--- 2. It is a data-based app.\n",
    "--- 3. It will have a GUI if I am able to learn tkinter in time :)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose / Problem Solved  \n",
    "_Why are you building this? What is the goal or benefit of your project?_\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Example: I want to practice using external APIs and conditionals. The app solves the problem of quickly checking the weather without visiting a website._\n",
    "\n",
    "--- I am building this so I can learn to apply my skills to businesses and use GUI's to make my interacting with my code more interactive. The app solves a problem by allowing gym owners to be up-to-date on the operations of their business by making all the necessary data easily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planned Features  \n",
    "_Check all that apply or add your own ideas:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Y] User input (e.g., city name, answer choice, key press)\n",
    "- [Y] Loops and conditionals\n",
    "- [Y] Functions or classes\n",
    "- [Y] File handling (`.txt`, `.csv`, or `.json`)\n",
    "- [Y] Simple GUI (Tkinter or Pygame)\n",
    "- [ ] External API\n",
    "- [ ] Web scraping\n",
    "- [Y] Score or data tracking\n",
    "- [Y] Restart/quit options\n",
    "- [ ] Data visualization (matplotlib, optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies / Concepts I Plan to Use  \n",
    "_List Python concepts, libraries, or tools you expect to use._\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example:  \n",
    "> - Python core (functions, loops, dictionaries)  \n",
    "> - requests (for API calls)  \n",
    "> - json module (to parse data)  \n",
    "> - Tkinter (for GUI)\n",
    "\n",
    "--- 1.Python concepts (OOP, loops, functions, dictionaries, databases)\n",
    "--- 2.Tkinter (for GUI)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source (if any)  \n",
    "_If your project uses external data, where is it coming from?_\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] API (e.g., OpenWeather, PokéAPI, NewsAPI)\n",
    "- [ ] Web scraping (e.g., quotes or news)\n",
    "- [ ] Local file (manually created `.csv` or `.json`)\n",
    "- [ ] No data needed\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria  \n",
    "_How will you know your project is complete? What’s the minimum version you must complete?_\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: The app will take a city name, return the weather, and show temperature and description. I’ll consider it complete when it handles errors and works with at least 5 cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- It will allow the user to add or remove gym members, to assign different workout plans to members, check payment status for current members and daily attendance for current members. I will consider it a success if it is able to store all this data without errors and the GUI is intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stretch Goals \n",
    "_What features would you add if you had extra time?_\n",
    "\n",
    "> - GUI version with Tkinter  \n",
    "> - Store search history in a file  \n",
    "> - Add weather icons\n",
    "\n",
    "--- 1. Make a web app using the same logic so that it is available to more users.\n",
    "--- 2. Add authentication and proper verification, so that their is admin access to private data and member access to log in attendance.\n",
    "--- 3. Add more data, such as inputting the time taken for each workout and storing it or allowing members to rate their workout plans."

    "Hi **@Eugene**,  \n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve come up with a strong, practical capstone idea with **GMS Pro – The Ultimate Gym Management System**. This project aligns very well with real-world business needs and gives you the opportunity to integrate multiple Python concepts, especially object-oriented programming, file handling, and possibly GUI development. Below is some structured feedback to help you clarify and expand your project as you build it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s Working Well\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Business-Oriented Focus**: It's great that you're targeting a real-world use case. Gym operations have many trackable metrics, and automating those through software is a great application of your Python skills.\n",
    "- **Clear Functional Goals**: Your plan to manage member registration, workout plans, payment status, and attendance covers key administrative needs of a gym.\n",
    "- **Stretch Mindset**: You’ve already considered advanced ideas like turning this into a web app and adding role-based access (admin/member), which shows vision and planning for future scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Features to Implement First\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a strong MVP (Minimum Viable Product), focus on getting the following features working **in the terminal or with a basic GUI**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature                   | Description |\n",
    "|--------------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Member Management**    | Add/remove members, store basic info (name, ID, plan type, contact). |\n",
    "| **Workout Plans**        | Assign/update/view personalized plans per member. |\n",
    "| **Attendance Tracking**  | Record daily check-ins and generate simple reports. |\n",
    "| **Payment Monitoring**   | Track payment status and highlight defaulters. |\n",
    "| **Persistent Storage**   | Save/load all data using JSON or CSV files. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Functional Ideas:\n",
    "- **Editable Profiles**: Allow updates to member details or assigned workout plans.\n",
    "- **Overdue Payments Flag**: Highlight members behind on payments in red or a pop-up alert.\n",
    "- **Workout History Logs**: Record completed workouts per session or week.\n",
    "- **Basic Search**: Allow users to search for a member by name or ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GUI Goals:\n",
    "- Use `Tkinter` to:\n",
    "  - Create buttons for actions like \"Add Member\", \"Assign Plan\", \"Mark Attendance\".\n",
    "  - Display member data in a table-like format using `ttk.Treeview`.\n",
    "  - Add pop-up windows or message boxes for alerts or confirmations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stretch Features:\n",
    "- **Authentication Layer**: Admin login to control data, member login to view/mark attendance.\n",
    "- **Workout Feedback**: Let members rate sessions or leave feedback.\n",
    "- **Web App Version**: Rebuild the logic using Flask or Django for broader accessibility.\n",
    "- **Analytics Dashboard**: Use simple visual summaries like number of active members, top attendance days, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "| Area               | Tools/Suggestions |\n",
    "|--------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **GUI**            | Tkinter + `ttk` widgets for tables and forms |\n",
    "| **Data Storage**   | Start with JSON, consider SQLite for long-term data handling |\n",
    "| **OOP Design**     | Use classes for `Member`, `WorkoutPlan`, `GymSystem` |\n",
    "| **Date Tracking**  | Use `datetime` for attendance logs and payment due dates |\n",
    "| **Input Validation** | Make sure names, dates, and payment fields are sanitized |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Success Looks Like\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll know your project is successful when:\n",
    "- It supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for members.\n",
    "- Each member has an assigned workout plan and payment status.\n",
    "- Attendance logs are created and retrievable.\n",
    "- The app runs with no data corruption and provides a basic GUI or clean terminal experience.\n",
